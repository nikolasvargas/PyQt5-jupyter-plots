Basic Game Design
-----------------

The goal of the game is to avoid incoming obstacles:
 * The player starts on the left side of the screen.
 * The obstacles enter randomly from the right and move left in a straight line.
The player can move, left, right, up, or down to avoid the obstacles.
The player cannot move off the screen.
The game ends either when player is hit by an obstacle or when the user closes the window.
